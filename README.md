# Next.js Dashboard Project

## Project Overview
This project was built along side the Next.js course, where I developed a UI Dashboard. The dashboard integrates with a PostgreSQL database and includes various functionalities, focusing on invoice management and customer data handling.

## Key Features
- **Dashboard Page**: An overview page that serves as the landing page of the business dashboard.
- **Invoice Management**: Includes an invoice table with search functionality, along with features to create and edit invoices.
- **Customer List Page**: Manages and displays customer data stored in the PostgreSQL database.
- **Authentication**: Implements secure login mechanisms to protect the dashboard and data access.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: Used for building the client-side of the dashboard.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling the dashboard with modern and responsive design elements.
- **PostgreSQL**: Backend database to store and manage invoice and customer data.
- **TypeScript**: Ensuring type safety and enhancing the development experience in the Next.js environment.
